        <p>
          Hi! Iâ€™m a data scientist passionate about solving real-world problems
          using machine learning, data analysis, and storytelling through data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience in Python, SQL, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and NLP
          techniques. I enjoy building interpretable models and deploying them to production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I love reading about AI ethics and volunteering in
          coding communities.
